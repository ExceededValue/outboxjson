# Examples of fediverse export files with attachments

### Mastodon instance mstdn.io
A post with two attachments and directory structure as it was in exported archive relatively to outbox.json

### Mastodon instance qoto.org
A post with one attachment and directory structure as it was in exported archive relatively to outbox.json

### Pleroma instance eientei.org
A post with one attachment. Pleroma export doesn't include attachments, but if instance is still alive, I think you can pre-download them before import (at least that's what I did when I was importing posts to my Mitra)

### Misskey instance misskey.de
A post with one attachment. Same as the Pleroma one, but an export file itself comes in exotic format, not like outbox.json from Mastodon and Pleroma
